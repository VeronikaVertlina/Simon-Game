# Simon-Game

In this challenge module we will be building a game that is modeled off the game Simon. So the way that it works is that you can press any key to start and it will show you a tile that you have to click on. And as you go from level to level, the patterns get more and more complicated, and at some point you're going to screw up, and it's going to tell you that youâ€™ve got it wrong and game is over, so you can press any key to restart the game.

It's going to test out your skills and what you've learned in the last module on jQuery, as well as some of the previously modules of the course 'The complete web development Bootcamp' with Angela.
